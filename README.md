Sleepless in New England: The Unseen Cost of Greatness
================

An analysis of the price New Englanders pay to support their sports dynasties.

The big 4 sports teams of New England - the Bruins (NHL), Celtics (NBA), Patriots (NFL), and Red Sox (MLB) - have enjoyed an unprecedented run of success, beginning in 2001 with the Patriots' win in Super Bowl XXXVI and continuing through the present, with the Red Sox once again reaching the World Series this year.

As a result of national interest in watching these talented teams, a disproportionate number of their games have been scheduled in the late evening, "prime time" slot. With games stretching longer and longer - especially in the MLB and NFL - diehard Boston fans have seen their bedtimes pushed back later and later.

Exactly to what extent has this phenomenon impacted the sleep & productivity of working & learning Bostonians, and what other sports-centric cities (if any) have faced similar burdens?
